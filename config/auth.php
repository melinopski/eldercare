    | Of course, a great default configuration has been defined for you
    | here which uses session storage and the Eloquent user provider.
    |
    | All authentication drivers have a user provider. This defines how the
    | users are actually retrieved out of your database or other storage
    | mechanisms used by this application to persist your user's data.
    |
    | Supported: "session", "token"

    /*
     The api driver uses a token driver and the web guard uses the session driver.
    This explains to Laravel how to maintain the authentication.
    Guards that use the session driver can be remembered using sessions and cookies.
    This means that users donâ€™t need to log in on every request.
    However, that means that the user needs to be physically looking at the page
    and accessing it in a browser.
    This is where the token driver comes in,
    the token driver requires authentication on every request via an api token.
    Laravel will look for an api_token field in the header of every request and
    authenticate a user in for every request they make. */
